# albert

A Substrate node template for experimental and development purposes only.

**Note:** `albert` is using the [Simplex](https://github.com/adoerr/lager/tree/main/simplex) block authoring and finalization consensus engine. So, it is most certainly **not** what you want to use as a regular Substrate node!
